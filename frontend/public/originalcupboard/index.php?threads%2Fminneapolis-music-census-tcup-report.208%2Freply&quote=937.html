[B]Overview [/B]

Last week TCUP members attended a city-led public discussion on the [URL=&#039;https://mplsartsandculture.org/2024-minneapolis-music-census&#039;]Minneapolis Music Census[/URL] - a survey developed by [URL=&#039;https://www.soundmusiccities.com/&#039;]Sound Music Cities[/URL] and conducted by the city of Minneapolis Arts &amp; Cultural Affairs department.

The event was attended by a mixture of city government officials, local music industry leaders, journalists, and the general public.

Overall, the census results and the response of attendees were aligned in identifying underpayment of artists and a lack of money in the music industry as a primary issue. This was encouraging to see, since TCUP has also named this as a primary issue to address in our work. While few attendees proposed concrete solutions to this issue, the idea of public investment in music was suggested multiple times (including by TCUP members).

Music industry participants noted that the survey results were not particularly representative of the scene demographically, and many attendees named issues of segregation, discrimination, and social silo-ing as primary concerns.

From the perspective of TCUP and our work, I believe this event was indicative of an organizing environment that will work in our favor. I saw a strong alignment on issues without a strong alignment on solutions, this suggests to me that a well-organized and labor-oriented approach to these issues might be extremely well-received.

[B]Intro Speakers[/B]

The event was facilitated by [URL=&#039;https://www.carlatiyaswanson.com/know&#039;]Carl Swanson[/URL] (NIVA, Springboard for the Arts) and began with a series of introductory speeches by various city leaders.

[URL=&#039;https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/mayor/&#039;]Mayor Jacob Frey[/URL] - spoke about his lack of artistic talent, being raised by ballet dancers, and about how this census will be part of the &#039;comeback of minneapolis&#039;. Mayor Frey left after his speech and did not hear any of the panel or discussion.

[URL=&#039;https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/city-council/members/ward-7/&#039;]Ward 7 CM Katie Cashman[/URL] - the council member of the ward where the event was being held spoke in praise of the census and of the collective expertise of the panel. CM Cashman also left after her speech and did not attend the remainder of the event.

[URL=&#039;https://mplsartsandculture.org/&#039;]Ben Johnson - Arts &amp; Cultural Affairs Director[/URL] &amp; [URL=&#039;https://mplsartsandculture.org/&#039;]Addy Gonzalez - Arts &amp; Cultural Affairs Executive Manager[/URL] - Ben spoke briefly about his and Addy&#039;s work with the ACA and praised Addy&#039;s efforts around the census (this was her project).

The bulk of the pre-panel intro was done by [URL=&#039;https://www.soundmusiccities.com/team&#039;]Don &#039;The Sound Whisperer&#039; Pitts[/URL], the president and founder of Sound Music Cities. During his speech, Don explained his involvement in the project, broke down the results of the census, and offered insights into how other cities have responded to the results of their own censuses.

Some of the results he highlighted were:

[I]-Lower participation in the music industry from the 18-24 year old demographic compared to pre-pandemic results
-Minneapolis was the 2nd lowest city in local gig payment averages
-Census respondents struggled with affordability issues, and that this was a nationwide trend even in places like Lawrence, KS and Greensboro, NC
-Minneapolis had low spending by musicians, comparatively 
-A strong desire from most respondents for more collaboration, &#039;music communities are inherently silo&#039;d and fragmented&#039;
-A nationwide trend where downtown venues are struggling more than suburban ones[/I]

Don did not suggest many solutions to these problems outright, but he took time to note how other cities and states have used census results to inform policy, including:

[I]Cleveland
-created an automated, live-updating music calendar 
-statewide live music fund bill has been introduced 
-live music export funding (money for local bands to tour)

New Orleans
-professional development series partnering with local music nonprofits
-reestablishing a defunct city org - the music &amp; entertainment commission

Chattanooga
-music journalism investment &amp; music meetups 
-citywide music coalition (task force)

Sacramento 
-new licensing categories for more live music opportunities 
-incubator style approach to live music investment
-task force creation &amp; music journalism investment

Nashville
-music coalition creation
-addressing parking issues

-Nationally, many cities have responded to their music census results by creating music industry task forces 
-Pitts encouraged &#039;dumpster diving&#039; for municipal funds that might be able to be redirected towards music
-His big takeaway is that the music census prompts community engagement[/I]

The few recommendations that Don did make were:

-[I]An anecdotal story about how young people struggle with getting gigs that are being held up by older folks
-Re-do the music census every 3-5 years
-Host music meetups to help with silo&#039;d scenes (partner with other orgs, don&#039;t do it alone)
-Have a weeklong local-music-oriented citywide event[/I]

Don then took questions from the audience, most of which had to with the validity of the survey results, especially in terms of demographic representation. When asked as to whether the lower participation of BIPOC, queer, younger, and poorer residents was indicative of the census accuracy or an inability of the survey to reach these demographics, Don responded with &#039;[I]its a mixture of both&#039;[/I], and explained how, in conducting the survey, the city first contacted orgs that had inroads into these underserved or marginalized communities in order to prioritize their feedback.

He did also stress the [URL=&#039;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)&#039;]statistical validity[/URL] of the census results, and explained that the administration of the census was the responsibility of the city rather than his, as a consultant.

Before I move on to the panel notes, I&#039;d like to editorialize a bit on the character that is Don Pitts and the music census in general. Having heard that [URL=&#039;https://www.soundmusiccities.com/music-census-cohort#:~:text=Join%20the%202025%20Cohort,2025%20multi%2Dcity%20music%20census.&amp;text=The%20cost%20per%20city%20is%20%2422%2C500.&#039;]the city spent 22k on this survey[/URL], I was suspicious of Sound Music Cities, and came prepared to write Don off as consultant-class grifter of public funds. After hearing him speak and seeing the published results of the census, I&#039;d have to say that I misjudged. Don came across as an awkward, data-loving guy who has spent a lot of time in the music industry, and who, by his own admission, had a deep disdain for both city government officials and consultants until he found himself playing both of these roles after his survey project found success. He did make the self-serving suggestion that Minneapolis conduct the census again every 3-5 years, but other than that, it sounds like Sound Music Cities has had a pretty hands-off role in this endeavor.

If anything, my critique of this survey is directed towards the city of Minneapolis and the Arts &amp; Cultural Affairs department. The ACA is a brand new department under pressure to demonstrate results to a mayoral administration that is prioritizing national participation &amp; recognition in its policy goals (&#039;the comeback of Minneapolis&#039;). Additionally, although their values and intentions seem to stem from a desire to create lasting and beneficial change for the city, both administrators at the ACA are profoundly unfamiliar with the Twin Cities music scene, and do not have the ties or trust needed to reach the underserved members of our community that have a distrust of the city government - a distrust that has only been made deeper in the last 4 years.

Despite the possible prematurity and gaps in representation of this survey, I do see that it has already served to galvanize folks in our community around the issue of pay inequity. For TCUP, I would stress intention before action, especially as related to partnerships with the city. To quote [URL=&#039;https://www.macphail.org/faculty/christopher-rochester/?filters=locations__minneapolis&#039;]Chris Rochester, Director of the Global Music Initiative at MacPhail[/URL] from the Q&amp;A at the event: &#039;[I]Have we failed at the jump due to the audience that we missed? Will decisions we make now have a negative impact on those audiences due to the faulty data?&#039;[/I]

[B]Panelist Discussion[/B]

Following Don&#039;s presentation, a group of six panelists were each given five minutes to share their thoughts on the census results. The panelists were all local music industry fixtures invited by MNIVA to participate and paid $75 for their time.

[URL=&#039;https://womenfolkradio.com/the-host&#039;]Ellen Stanley - radio host, event facilitator, musician[/URL]

Ellen named that she wanted to prioritize un-siloing music communities. &#039;I would love to see the walls of the scene come down... some folks feel like they aren&#039;t invited to the party.&#039;
One aspect of the scene with which she took issue was residencies - there are too many residencies run by musicians that have well-established careers. Those folks are in charge of booking those nights and this leads to a stagnation of the scene with fewer performance opportunities at bars for up-and-coming artists.

[URL=&#039;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanner-montague-9503666b&#039;]Tanner Montague - Green Room Co-Owner, Musician[/URL]

Tanner spoke to the tension between his desire to pay musicians fairly and the financial reality of venue ownership. &#039;Its tough to pay artists what i would want to be paid, $231 is not a liveable wage&#039;.  Regarding the dwindling revenue streams of music, Tanner named that the public were buying fewer tickets to shows and drinking less - and that the latter was not necessarily a bad thing even if it was a detriment to his business, &#039;it feels weird to be pushing poison&#039;. Tanner also noted that cities with a higher average pay per gig, like Nashville, were music tourism destinations in a way that Minneapolis was not.

[URL=&#039;https://www.freezepoprecords.com/&#039;]Symone Wilson - Freeze Pop Records President, Performing Artist, TCUP member[/URL]

Symone spoke on the need for more professional development, as reflected in quotes from the music census. This need was highlighted in the loss of educational institutions like IPR and McNally Smith, and Symone expressed a desire to fill the gap left by these for-profit entities with community collaboration. To this point, she named a perceived scarcity mindset as a potential obstacle to this collaboration, observing that often individuals desired to create their own independent project as opposed to building within existing structures.

&#039;i dont see the census as negative, i am inspired in our ability to acknowledge our pain points and come together in this moment to see the ways in which we can create change&#039;

Referring to the representative accuracy of the census, Symone called out that the music-income reported by the participants as something that did not match her experience or that of the artists she worked with.

Symone also noted that music tourism was a source of funding for artists that Minneapolis does not currently generate. She recounted an experience working with artists who acted as &#039;ambassadors&#039; for their hometown and whose tour was funded by their city&#039;s music tourism industry.

Her final note was about the accessibility of grant funding compared to its relative abundance in MN.

[URL=&#039;https://www.gullyboysband.com/&#039;]Nadi McGill - TCUP Leader, Musician[/URL]

Nadi spoke on the work that TCUP is already doing in relation to the issues highlighted by the music census.

On segregated music scenes, &#039;TCUP wants to shake these silos up and work together to make Minnesota the best place in the world to be a musician&#039;

In regards to the low gig pay averages, Nadi called out the need for more money in the system, and pointed out the tension that currently exists between performers and venues: If the top concern of artists is pay, and the top concern of venues is the cost of talent, the result is an antagonistic relationship instead of a collaborative one.

Nadi was one of the few speakers at the event who spoke on potential solutions. They referred to Austin&#039;s live music fund as a way to alleviate venue/artist tension, and they called out the Minneapolis&#039; entertainment tax that, in its current form, extracts revenue from local music and funnels it upwards to pay for sports stadiums and convention center costs.

In a particularly impactful moment, Nadi broke down the revenue struggles of musicians by recounting an anecdote of a 5-piece band that spends 8 hours total at a local venue to play a gig and walk away with the equivalent of $6.90 per hour, per person.

Nadi closed their analysis with a skepticism on the representative accuracy of the survey. One data point that showed 69% of survey respondents were homeowners, which, when compared to the 48% overall rate of home ownership in Minneapolis, suggests that the music census did not accurately capture the perspectives of lower-income musicians.

[URL=&#039;http://www.theavantgardeis.com/about.html&#039;]Chadwick Niles Phillips - CEO/Founder of The Avant Garde, Performer[/URL]

Chadwick was particularly critical of the racial makeup demonstrated by the survey and of the data around perceived racism in the music industry, &#039;theres a lot going on under the surface that keep people of color away from the industry&#039;. Chadwick expanded on this critique by explaining how black music is generally underserved in Minneapolis; most venues do not book a wide array of black music, and often black music festivals or events are not actually run by black people. Despite all this, Chadwick noted that the Minneapolis sound came from Prince and other people of color of that era. Chadwick suggested programs that focus on POC retention, similar to private-sector DEI initiatives, as well as stressing a need to un-silo the music scenes in order to improve public perception of Minneapolis.

Chadwick also named how important touring was for artist income in 2024, underscoring a need for more music export investment. He implored artists to be more proactive and to seek out grant funding, anecdotally noting that he did not know how to access grant funding till he started looking.

[URL=&#039;https://www.mcpherson.club/&#039;]Sean McPherson - Radio Host, Trivia Mafia Founder, Musician[/URL]

Sean expressed a worry about what the census results might portend for the local scene, &#039;I&#039;d really like young BIPOC people to stay in Minneapolis, not for a loss of momentum but because they are thriving&#039;. But, he noted, if even older white people were not getting paid in the music industry, that did not bode will for his wish, and that he feared we were in a period of &#039;lifting up the ladder&#039;, both anecdotally and as demonstrated by the results of the data.

Sean observed that there were fewer points of access to the music scene than there were when he was coming up. &#039;Where are the new band nights?&#039;, he wondered, and noted that First Ave served a very different purpose for the scene than it did 25 years ago.

Sean closed his analysis by naming industry trends that likely contribute to the depressed pay seen in the survey. More musicians rely on touring for income since the advent of digital music, which in Minnesota means that winter months show dates (previously unattractive to touring acts) were now being competed for between local and national acts. Sean, like Tanner, spoke on the trend of declining alcohol sales and highlighted the importance of decoupling live music revenue from alcohol sales.

[B]Post-Panel Discussion[/B]

After the panel, the event was opened to the attendees for discussion. Notable speakers include:


[USER=6]@laura.kiernan[/USER]  - TCUP member &amp; musician who stressed that her major takeaway from this event is that musicians need to ORGANIZE. &#039;I want to gather as many young folks, bipoc, and queer people to show up and share their voices... lets make it inevitable that artists get paid.&#039;

Andrew Scott-Chan - Producer and DJ who noted venue scarcity as something the diy DJ scene is struggling with.

Vie Bohem - a creative-ventures business owner who expressed frustration with venues that would not stick to a long term residency/partnership. Noted that there are business management skills missing that would allow performers to make a living off of music.
