      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I&#039;m playing drums in a new project with my friend Cassidy on guitar. We&#039;ve got a few songs mostly roughed out and we are seeking a bassist. I always struggle to describe genres. He called it New Wave Death Blues, which isn&#039;t entirely accurate, but I don&#039;t have a better idea. He&#039;s into extreme metal and angular dissonant things, as well as Primus and other 90&#039;s stuff, and he is a very talented player. I like to hang out in the pocket and just play rock&#039;n&#039;roll, but my writing...<br />

I make singer-songwriter folk music, but most of my connections are in the hardcore and rave scenes. Any advice you can give me on finding folk shows/venues would be greatly appreciated, and if anybody is looking to fill a slot with a folk performance, that would be even better!</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Howdy,<br />
<br />
My name is Peter.  I sing and play keys and guitar in we are the willows.  I also drummed on our newest record. <br />
<br />
I started playing music as a drummer and it’s still one of my favorite things to do.  I’d like to play more.<br />
<br />
This is subject to change but it’s safe to say  I can play 1 show a month and can generally be available for 2-3 rehearsals before a show.  My day rate is $150 (just for the performance.  No charge for rehearsals).  I’m probably not reliable as a main drummer but...<br />

     I&#039;ve been doing music most of my life, hopping from ensemble to ensemble, casual group to school band, instrument to instrument. I&#039;d like to join a group and really get into the local scene. Enough drifting around!<br />

<br />
My band Stone Ark is looking for a guitar player with strong rhythm and lead guitar skills that wants to join as a core member of the group. We actively gig about twice a month, often more during the summer, with rehearsal at least once a week on the weekends. <br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hiya!<br />
<br />
Though my own work is more experimental, I&#039;m really good as a side person and collaborator. When I lived in Iowa, I played pretty consistently in bands with rappers, singers, poets, and everything in between. I can learn music fast, read, improvise, and do some production stuff. I have done some remote recording.<br />
<br />
I contributed recently to this recording (which isn&#039;t out yet, so don&#039;t share <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png" class="smilie smilie--emoji" loading="lazy" width="64" height="64" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)"  data-smilie="1"data-shortname=":)" /><br />
