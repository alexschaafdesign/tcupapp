<br />
I’m making some collages for TCUP’s socials and I need some photos of bands loading in, soundchecking, running merch, hanging in the green room, etc.  Basically, anything from the day of a show that shows  the non-music making labor parts of the job.<br />
<br />
Do you have any and are you willing to share them?  If so, drop ‘em in this thread and lmk the handle you’d like tagged.<br />

Thanks!<br />

<br />
Over the last couple months we&#039;ve collected feedback about different venues around town with our <a href="https://airtable.com/appBxG22efe9yoPaa/pagoL9lvXsNovlvak/form" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Venue Report Card Survey</a> - and we have noticed some shady practices at Day Block Brewery that I&#039;ll detail below. Have you played a show there recently? What was your experience? <br />
<br />
-We have consistently heard from TCUP members and VRC respondents that the venue is inconsistent when it comes to ticketing at shows. If someone is running the door, they might cut the door halfway...<br />

<br />
I was very disappointed that a booker with Caydence expected us to &quot;pay to play&quot; for a show that is intended to raise aid for community members. The message I received felt extremely disrespectful and made me feel humiliated when all of us are trying to organize and do a good thing.<br />
<br />
Back story, we recently got in touch with Caydence to host a benefit show with a bill full of young folks ages 17-24. The show was initially going to be for LA fire relief aid as we started planning...<br />

<br />
I just recorded a full length album and I am trying to figure out where to release it! It&#039;s based in jazz and improv, but it falls more in line with the modern, post-rock, sometimes experimental category - think Jeff Parker, Tortoise, a little bit Bad Plus, Alice Coltrane. I am looking at local labels: Shifting Paradigm, Aura Vortex, Innova, and wanted to see what folks&#039; experience has been. What has releasing with a label done for you? Have you had to put up money for promotion...<br />

Hey, <br />
<br />
My name is Nathaniel I have been in the Twin Cities music scene for about a year now. I have loved being on stage as a drummer and am looking for another band to join, but I also have found a love for working behind the scenes for bands. I am young, but I have a good background in live sound, photography, and sales, which I think would all be beneficial in different ways...<br />

i&#039;m collecting “advance horror stories” (i.e., tales of past gigs where lack of a clear show advance/contract caused issues for you and/or your band), as well as positive thoughts/experiences surrounding show advances, for the next issue of the TCUP newsletter!<br />

He&#039;s into extreme metal and angular dissonant things, as well as Primus and other 90&#039;s stuff, and he is a very talented player. I like to hang out in the pocket and just play rock&#039;n&#039;roll, but my writing...<br />
