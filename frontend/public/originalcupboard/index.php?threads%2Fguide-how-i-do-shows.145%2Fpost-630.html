<span style="font-size: 26px">HOW I DO SHOWS???</span><br />
by TCUP&#8203;</div><br />
Like many industries, the &quot;live music&quot; world can sometimes feel opaque and confusing from the outside (and also...the inside), with lots of knowledge that can be hard to come by if you don&#039;t have a ton of experience - inscrutable lingo (What are &quot;deads&quot;? What does &quot;front of house&quot; mean?? What is a &quot;buyout&quot;??!! What does &quot;Spotify demonetized my music&quot; mean???!!!), poor communication, some venue owners doing their best to rip you off, intimidating sound engineers, and more.<br />
<br />
And like many industries, the barrier to entry is higher if you&#039;re not a straight white dude with lots of straight white dude friends who play in bands already who tell you what to do / how to get shows / ask you if you want to &quot;jam&quot; sometime / care way more about having expensive guitars than actually learning how to play guitar / secretly think Joe Rogan has some good ideas, and so on.<br />

This guide is an attempt to help level the playing field, to present some shared wisdom from musicians who have been at it a while.  This is merely one perspective, mostly around the &quot;playing small clubs / rooms around 60-500 capacity&quot; world, based on our varied experiences. These &quot;best practices&quot; and tips are by no means definitive, set in stone, or immovable. Ya gotta find what works for you but if you don’t know what that is yet, this is a good place to start!<br />
<br />
Some of this may seem obvious, but hopefully there&#039;s helpful info for everyone here - from (one end of the spectrum) someone who&#039;s never played a show,  to (the other end of the spectrum) a member of the Grateful Dead.<br />
<br />
 This is organized roughly by order-of-operations when booking a show + playing that show.<br />
<br />
note: I&#039;m using the word &quot;band&quot; throughout as shorthand for &quot;artist / musician / performer / etc&quot;, obviously not everyone is in a &quot;band&quot; but i&#039;m lazy<br />

	<div class="bbCodeSpoiler-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler">
			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">There are many different ways that artists/bands get themselves on a show -- sometimes your friend will ask you to join their show, sometimes you set up your own complete lineup and talk to a venue to get the show booked, sometimes the venue will email you to see if you can join a random bill, sometimes you go on the popular singing competition show American Idol and land a major label deal and then your high-powered booking agent gets you booked on a tour opening up for another former American Idol contestant, sometimes an out-of-town touring band will get in touch with you, the &quot;local band,&quot; to jump on their bill and help boost turnout.<br />
<br />
There are also many different kinds of venues/shows (house/DIY, small club, outdoor festival, etc) and they all work slightly differently, but this guide is generally relevant to the &quot;small club&quot; world, with plenty of tips applicable in all scenarios.<br />
<br />
A few different ways that &quot;playing a show at a small club&quot; can happen --&gt;<br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Email a venue with a proposed show / lineup, and give them a couple options for dates.  This is &quot;your show&quot; and generally you&#039;re the headliner</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Another band who you know personally asks you to join their bill --- this is very common and leads to fun shows, but is also hard for some people to make happen (newcomers, introverts, etc).  The best thing you can do is just to be a nice person, make friends in the scene, and let things happen organically.  (alternatively, slide them a thick wad of bills and slyly ask if they&#039;re still looking for anyone to play their show)  In this case, they are the headliner and you are &quot;support&quot;</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">If you don&#039;t know many people in the scene yet, check out venues around town to get an idea of what kinds of places you&#039;d like to play, and look up other bands that are on some shows there - if you like em, start following them or whatever, slowly get an idea of the network of bands in town</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Email the booking contact at a venue that you&#039;re interested in playing, asking to be considered as support on other bills - this is harder if they don&#039;t know you at all, but its something</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Go to shows!  Lots of shows!  You&#039;ll slowly start to meet people and make yourself known as an option for future shows</li>
</ul></div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div><br />
<span style="font-size: 18px">What are the venue&#039;s motivations for booking me?  Why do they care how many people I might bring out?</span><br />

		<span>Spoiler: <span class="bbCodeSpoiler-button-title">The venue&#039;s point of view</span></span>
	</span></button>
	<div class="bbCodeSpoiler-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler">
			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content"><b>Let&#039;s look at this process from the venue&#039;s point of view:</b><br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Let&#039;s pretend that you own a small music venue (and you are relatively cool and not an asshole) --</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Your venue is a for-profit business (like most venues, unfortunately) and doesn&#039;t have outside funding / non-profit grants, etc</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">The simple model you&#039;re working with is &quot;Bands have fans - fans that might come and see them play - and if those bands play at <i>my</i> venue, those fans will come and be potential &#039;customers&#039; for me. &quot;</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">The first (and most automatic) way I&#039;ll make money is by selling tickets to the shows.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">But I need to make sure the bands are paid well so that they come back and play here again + tell their friends to play here</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">So I&#039;ll give the band a majority of the ticket sales - anywhere from 50-80%</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">That leaves me with 20-50% of the ticket sales, which unfortunately is not enough for my business to survive</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">So I need to find other ways to bring in revenue -<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">I could have my building be open during the day as a coffeeshop, or record store, or restaurant</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">I can sell food / drinks during the show</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Both of those rely on people coming in and spending money -- the more people in the crowd, the more money I&#039;ll make on these other things</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Since I&#039;m so cool, i&#039;ll even give the band a cut of the bar money if it gets over a certain point! (Just kidding, no one is this cool)</li>
</ul>The main point is - <b>venues need there to be a crowd at the show / good attendance</b> - and this is helpful to know when approaching them to book a show.  They often have options, and if one show will probably bring in more people than the other show, they&#039;re going to go with that one, since they are a business.<br />
<br />
But do not fear! This is where multi-band bills are helpful, because say you are a small band who could maybe get 10-15 of your friends to come.  That alone is not great attendance, but if you ask 2 other bands to play, and they also bring 10-15, now we&#039;re talking 30-45, which is much better!  And maybe one of them has a better draw (draw = &#039;how many people a band can bring out&#039;, like &quot;this band usually draws around 120 people to a show&quot; or &quot;They have a good draw&quot;) and they bring 20-25.  Now it&#039;s starting to make sense for the venue to take a chance on this show.<br />
<br />
And to state the obvious -- there are many shows that happen all the time that DON&#039;T have a big crowd, and that&#039;s totally fine!  If you approach a venue for a show, and you don&#039;t have a huge track record or examples of bringing a lot of people to a show, they&#039;ll most likely book you on a less-popular day, like a Tuesday or Wednesday - because those days have naturally smaller crowds anyways, so the difference between your 10 people being at the show and another shows&#039;s 50 is not that huge.  Whereas Fridays and Saturdays will naturally have bigger crowds, and they want to capitalize on that by booking a bigger band -- your 10 people versus another band&#039;s 310 people is very significant.</div>

<span style="font-size: 18px">When booking my own show, do I get a date confirmed with the venue first, and then ask other bands to play? Or how do I do it? </span><br />

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">If you have some bands in mind, first see if they are generally interested/available, with a rough timeline (&quot;Would you be down to play my show sometime in early September? Are there any days that do NOT work for you?&quot;)<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">For example, here&#039;s an actual text I got a few weeks ago - <i>&quot;hey would you be interested in playing with us at our album release show? we’re aiming for october and im trying to get some people on board. lemme know either way <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png" class="smilie smilie--emoji" loading="lazy" width="64" height="64" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)"  data-smilie="1"data-shortname=":)" />&quot;</i></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">obviously i responded &quot;do you know who i am? i am way too famous for that&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">You generally want to start this process at least 2-3 months in advance - that makes it more likely you&#039;ll find an open date, and it will also give you more time to promote the show + lead to a better turnout!</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Find the venue&#039;s booking info (we have a list of local MN venues and their booking contacts <a href="https://tcupboard.org/threads/booking-contacts-local-to-twin-cities.69/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Ftcupboard.org%2Fthreads%2Fbooking-contacts-local-to-twin-cities.69%2F&amp;hash=176b72afd2ade974473bdb830e93ccaf" rel="noopener">here</a>) -- sometimes its a form embedded in a venue&#039;s website, sometimes they list a specific email contact.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Send an email/message to inquire about a show, giving them 2-3 dates as possibilities.  They can put a <b>hold </b>on those dates for you - this does NOT mean you have the show booked yet though -<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Getting a hold on a date means that the venue will mark the date for you while they continue to book the date for other parties.  Think of it as them writing the date in pencil until they decide which show to book. You may find that you’ll get a 2nd or 3rd hold. That means you’re 2nd or 3rd in line to get the show.  Asking a venue to hold a date can be helpful on your first outreach to the venue or if you’re booking a tour and aren’t sure which date you’ll be at their venue.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Challenge -- </b>If you have a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. hold on a date, and you have all of your ducks in a row (other bands booked, finances sorted, etc.) you can challenge the other holds for the date.  That means that the talent buyer will consider your date against the other holds they have.  If your show looks more promising, they might go with you.  I only ever do this when I need to know for sure if the date is happening.  If I don’t get the date, I usually look into something else.</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Make sure you get WRITTEN CONFIRMATION that the show is yours before you start promoting it,</b> making posters etc.</li>

		<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler">
			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">In many cases, a venue has a standard &#039;deal&#039; that they offer to most bands, where there&#039;s not really much room to &#039;negotiate&#039; - but of course feel free to ask for a better deal if you want to!  Either way, <b>make sure you understand AHEAD OF TIME what the deal is</b>. It is <i>not acceptable</i> for the venue to wait til the show is done to tell you what the $ deal was. (unfortunately though, this does happen all the time, so just do your best)<br />
<br />
The deal could be:<br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Door Deal (very common)</b><br />
This means that your payment (or &#039;payout&#039;) depends on how many tickets were sold - and it often incorporates the venue&#039;s expenses into the consideration<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">An example deal -- &quot;70/30 after $150&quot;</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">This means that the bands get 70% of the ticket sales - BUT only after the venue covers their expenses.  In this case, the venue is spending $150 to pay the sound engineer/door person etc, and so the first $150 in ticket sales doesn&#039;t go to the bands, it goes to the venue.  After that, IF their expenses have been covered, the bands get 70% of what&#039;s left.  This is not a great model, because it often results in bands getting $0, if they don&#039;t sell enough tickets to cover the venue&#039;s expenses -- something that shouldn&#039;t be the band&#039;s responsibilty (the venue is often selling alcohol etc but they never, ever, take that into consideration) but unfortunately this is what we&#039;ve got</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">So in that scenario, let&#039;s say tickets are $15 and there were 34 paid attendees -<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">34 x $15 = $510</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">The venue takes $150 out first = $360</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">70% goes to the bands = $252</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">if three bands split that evenly = $84 per band (...hooray)</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Quick note - <b>sometimes</b> <b>the &#039;headliner&#039; of the show will get one lump payment from the venue, and they are responsible for paying the other bands on the bill.</b> That can feel awkward sometimes, but the best thing to do is communicate with the other bands ahead of time -- if you&#039;re headlining - whether you&#039;re going to evenly split the money, or if you as the &#039;headliner&#039; are going to take a slightly higher cut - or if you&#039;re opening - ask the headlining band what the deal is -- just talk about it ahead of time!</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Sometimes the deal is &#039;from dollar one&#039; which means there are no venue expenses to take care of first, you are guaranteed pay if even one ticket is sold in this case.   The band&#039;s percentage is often lower in this case, since the venue is more at risk.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">In the above show example, if the deal was 60/40 from dollar one, that&#039;d be:<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">34 x $15 = $510</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">No expenses are taken out</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">60% of the door = $306</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">if three bands split that evenly = $102 per band</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Guarantee (less common)</b><br />
A guarantee is a set dollar amount that you will receive from the venue or promoter. &quot;$800 guarantee&quot; means you get $800 no matter what, whether its a small crowd or sold-out. Be sure to communicate about whether that guarantee is just for your band or for the whole package. If it’s for the whole package, then you need to communicate with the other bands about how much they get. Guarantees tend to happen at less traditional shows - like college shows, outdoor festivals, brewery gigs, that kind of thing. <b>If you get a guarantee, the venue HAS to pay you that, regardless of turnout. </b> (assuming you showed up and played the show and didn&#039;t like, murder anyone)</li>

<i><span style="font-size: 22px">I BOOKED A SHOW.  NOW WHAT? </span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px">What do I need to decide ahead of time with the other bands?</span><br />

			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content"><ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Make sure you agree on the <b>lineup / order / set lengths</b>--<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">generally the headliner/band who sets the show up plays last, but not always -- the idea is that whatever band has the biggest draw should play last, so that the other bands on the bill have a good crowd for their sets - if the &#039;biggest band&#039; played first, a lot of people might leave when they&#039;re done and that screws the other bands over.  This can get complicated, as everyone wants a &#039;good slot&#039; and that could mean different things to different people, so just make sure you discuss ahead of time and make sure it makes sense.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Also make sure you discuss set lengths - you should know ahead of time how long you are expected to play (and please adhere to that, if you run long you are affecting the other bands&#039; sets and they will never, ever forget it, until their dying breaths)</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Discuss <b>backline </b>(the amps/drums/gear on stage, not counting the PA or lights) - sometimes venues will have a &#039;house kit&#039; or &#039;house amps&#039; that you can use, and sometimes the bands will have to bring everything<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">It can be very helpful to talk to the other bands to see if anyone is willing to share their gear -- like &quot;I&#039;m bringing my bass amp and the other bands are welcome to use it!&quot; -- this can make changeover (the time between bands) easier/quicker, if you aren&#039;t having to take down/put up all the gear every time the bands switch</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">It&#039;s almost always a good idea to share ONE DRUM KIT -- whether its the house kit or one of the bands&#039; -- often the headliner will bring the drums, set them up for their (early) soundcheck, and then leave them there for the other bands.  Sound engineers usually prefer this, because otherwise they have to take down all their drum mics + re-mic the new kit, which can be quite time-consuming / annoying.</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Make sure everyone is aware of the <b>payment</b> structure - &quot;We&#039;ll do an even split among all 3 bands of whatever the door amount is&quot; etc</li>
</ul><i>Example emails</i><br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a real world example of an email sent by the headlining band, in order to coordinate gear and decide on set times, etc.  In this example, the show has been officially booked, and the email was sent 3-4 days before the show (but you can also start this communication much earlier)<br />
<br />
Some notes about this example email:<br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">An &quot;Advance&quot; is a form with all the info you’ll need for the show: ROS (run-of-show: the schedule for the night), load in time, directions, wifi info, green room info, etc.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">To &quot;advance&quot; a show means to be communicating about this information (The venue might say &quot;Hey bands, I&#039;m reaching out to advance your upcoming show, can you let me know the following information? (which could include your stage plot, how many people are in your band, etc&quot; or the bands might say &quot;Hey venue, i&#039;m reaching out to advance our upcoming show, can you let us know the schedule for the night, how many guest list spots we get, etc?)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">When Peter says &quot;We&#039;ll be back lining our drums and bass amp/cab&quot;, that means that he will bring that equipment with the expectation that other bands use it<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Sharing gear is helpful for everyone</b>: the opening bands (they don&#039;t have to bring drums) the headliner (they don&#039;t have to move their drums after their soundcheck) and the sound engineer (they don&#039;t have to change a ton of stuff in between bands)</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">When Peter says &quot;Please have your drummer bring breakables (snare &amp; cymbals)&quot; -- this refers to the (very common) situation where there is a shared drumkit, but the other drummers will bring their own snare and cymbals (no hardware/stands, just the snare and cymbals themselves), since those are more specific to the drummer&#039;s taste, and are quickly swappable compared to setting up a whole brand new kit.  Why are they called breakables?  It&#039;s because....I don&#039;t really know.  Just nod along every time you hear it, like I do.</li>

			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">If the venue doesn&#039;t tell you a schedule, and it&#039;s &quot;up to the bands&quot; - they should at least be able to tell you what time music can start, and what time it needs to be done by.  If you have 3 bands on the bill, and it starts at 8pm, a typical schedule might be:<br />
<br />
8-8:30pm - 1st band<br />
8:45-9:30 - 2nd band<br />
9:45-10:45 - 3rd band<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
8-8:45pm - 1st band<br />
9-9:45pm - 2nd band<br />
10:45pm - 3rd band<br />
<br />
These examples are with a 15 minute changeover time (changeover=the time in between bands).  This is the shortest a changeover should ever be -- anything less is not realistic.  But you also don&#039;t want too much time in between -- if it&#039;s 30 minutes, that could mean there&#039;s like 15 minutes of &#039;dead air&#039; where the band is ready to go / set up, but not started yet.  The audience will not be incredibly psyched on this.<br />
<br />
Typically the headliner/last band will have the longest set, and the first band will have the shortest set (of course there can be exceptions to this).</div>

<i><span style="font-size: 22px">DAY OF THE SHOW</span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px">What does the day of the show look like? How do sound checks work?</span><br />


<div class="bbCodeSpoiler">

	<div class="bbCodeSpoiler-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler">
			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">A sound check means you get to the venue earlier in the day, before the doors are open to the public (unless it&#039;s a bar or something where people are there already). The venue&#039;s sound engineer will meet you there -- right away you should say hi to this person, and ask if they got your stage plot and are aware of your band&#039;s setup (sometimes they won&#039;t be / they didn&#039;t get the stage plot, and that&#039;s usually fine too)<br />
<br />
A typical schedule for a 3 band bill:<br />
3pm - headliner/3rd band load-in (be at the venue by this time, to start loading in your gear)<br />
4pm - headliner sound check / 2nd band load-in<br />
5pm - 2nd band sound check / 1st band load-in<br />
6pm - 1st band sound check<br />
7pm - doors open to public<br />
8-8:30pm - 1st band<br />
8:45-9:30 - 2nd band<br />
9:45-10:45 - 3rd band<br />
<br />
Ideally, everyone gets a soundcheck - but that&#039;s not always the case.  Typically the headliner/last band gets to the venue first, sets up their gear and does a soundcheck, and then they move whatever they need to (amps, etc) for the band before them, which then does the same (this is where sharing gear comes in handy).<br />
<br />
The opening band of the night should always soundcheck <i>last</i>, so that when they are done, they leave all of their gear on stage as-is before returning later for their set.<br />
<br />
Sometimes all you can get is a <b>line check</b>, which means you aren&#039;t able to check anything before the show (this is common for the middle band) - a line check happens during the show, right before your set.  You set up all your stuff and quickly check each line (mic or input) to make sure it&#039;s all working, while you&#039;re trying to look cool in front of your friends.  The sound engineer will then use the first song or two from your actual set to dial things in and get it sounding right, which is why it&#039;s not as ideal as a regular sound check, but it often is fine.<br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">After your soundcheck, make sure to ask the engineer &quot;Where should deads go?&quot; because it&#039;ll prove that you&#039;re a real professional using industry lingo (&quot;deads&quot; mean empty cases - guitar cases, etc - &quot;Where should we put our empty cases?&quot;)</li>

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">A stage plot is a visual representation of the band on stage, along with the inputs needed</li>
</ul>Some tips about this:<br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Don&#039;t be super stressed about this, especially if you don&#039;t have much knowledge about mics or how the PA system works - just make sure that you are communicating to the sound engineer<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">who is in your band (like &quot;We have a bassist, a drummer, two guitarists, and three of us sing&quot; - the engineer would have enough to go on from just that)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">any special needs you might have - &quot;I want to play something out of my phone for a couple songs&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">On the other end of the spectrum, don&#039;t feel like you have to be too specific, unless you really need to (things like &quot;Use an SM58 for vocals please&quot; aren&#039;t really necessary -- you don&#039;t want to come off as condescending or controlling to the sound engineer, they are (or should be) pros who generally know what they&#039;re doing)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Similarly, if you have a typical drum kit, don&#039;t worry about listing each drum (&quot;Floor tom, two rack toms, two cymbals&quot;) etc - you can just say &quot;Drums&quot;, they&#039;ll know what to do</li>

	</span></button>
	<div class="bbCodeSpoiler-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler">
			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">Your relationship with the house sound engineer is very important if you want to have an enjoyable show.  Many sound engineers are super great and friendly, a real pro who is there to support you and listen to your needs. that rules!<br />
<br />
Andddddd many are the opposite - tired, jaded middle aged men who don&#039;t think women know how gear works, or who freak out at the sight of a TC Helicon vocal pedal, or who grumble at the fact that you aren&#039;t a simple guitar rock band and you need a couple DIs or something.  These people suck ass, but it&#039;s important to do your best to keep things from getting hostile - this can be quite tricky and not fun or fair, but you&#039;re kind of stuck working with this person and don&#039;t have any other options - so i try and keep things light and respectful as much as I can, <i>out of self-interest</i> --&gt; I want things to sound good, and that&#039;s more likely if you have a sound engineer who doesn&#039;t necessarily know that you detest them.  Try best you can to keep the overall stress level low.  (This shouldn&#039;t just be on us, but sometimes it is what it is)<br />
<br />
Some general tips:<br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">When you get to the venue, it&#039;ll usually be obvious who the sound engineer is, but just ask around to find &quot;Who&#039;s running our sound tonight?&quot; or &quot;Who&#039;s the front of house?&quot;  (Front of house means the sound engineer who is out...front. in bigger venues, you&#039;ll often have both a &#039;Front of house&#039; engineer and a &#039;Monitors&#039; engineer, but at most small clubs, one person does both)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Introduce yourself and your band, learn their name (and write it down so you don&#039;t forget it - i always put it on my set list so i remember to thank them, and also if i need any adjustments during the show)<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">For any Dudes reading this -- This is a bit tricky, but sometimes the engineers will assume they only need to talk to the men/masc people in the band -- if you&#039;re one of those Dudes, try not to &quot;speak for&quot; the femme people in your band (unless they want you to) -- tell the engineer to ask your bandmates about their setups directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Right away, i usually ask &quot;Should we start setting up on stage, or do you want to run lines first?&quot; (meaning, do they want to set all the mics up first, or should we put up our gear and then they put up the mics -- its usually the second case, but some people work differently)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">A typical soundcheck will include checking each instrument at a time, and then doing a full song or two.  Every sound engineer doesn&#039;t do things exactly the same, but sometimes during the initial check of each instrument at a time, each band member can raise their hand pointing up, to indicate that they want more of that specific thing in their monitor mix -- or point down if you want less (i hope you can understand the incredibly complicated logic to these hand signals)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">During the soundcheck you should make sure your monitor mix is good enough (it&#039;ll never be perfect), and you can hear what you&#039;re doing.  Never be afraid to ask for what you need (up to a point - &quot;good enough&quot; should be the goal, for the sake of everyone&#039;s sanity).</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">During the show, you can also ask for adjustments at any time - i usually do this after the first song if there&#039;s something super off in my monitor.  But try not to ever imply that the sound engineer isn&#039;t doing a good job or something, when you&#039;re in front of the crowd.  Again, &quot;good enough&quot; is the goal - once the show starts, it&#039;s not really the time to get super nit-picky about your monitor mix, it tends to be distracting to the crowd and you lose your momentum.</li>

	</span></button>
	<div class="bbCodeSpoiler-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler">
			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">You should always expect to get paid the day of the show (there are some exceptions, sometimes with college shows or shows for a big organization, they&#039;ll mail you a check a week later or something, but that&#039;s not the norm).<br />
<br />
The venue often wants a W9 tax form from you - you either send it as part of your advance, or give it to them the day of.<br />
<br />
When you get to a show, one of the first questions to ask is &quot;Who do I settle up with?&quot; (&quot;Settling&quot; is what most venue people say when they are referring to &quot;Paying the band&quot;).<br />
<br />
When it&#039;s a door deal show, settling will almost always happen at the end, because they have to add up the sales and calculate percentages.  Or if its a guarantee, you usually get that check after the show as well.   Best case, you get a settlement sheet then that looks something like this:<br />

		<span>Spoiler: <span class="bbCodeSpoiler-button-title">Here&#039;s an example of a simple rider</span></span>
	</span></button>
	<div class="bbCodeSpoiler-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler">
			<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">Yellow Ostrich / KVS hospitality rider as of Sept 2022<br />
12 pack water bottles<br />
12 pack hard seltzers (white claw, etc)<br />
6 pack non-alcoholic beer (ideally Lagunitas NA or Athletic, something craft/IPA)<br />
1 bottle red wine (natural if possible)<br />
1 bag tortilla chips<br />
1 container medium salsa<br />
fruit: apples + bananas<br />
thanks!</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">The fun thing is, venues honor these requests approximately 1% of the time!  You&#039;ll usually just get &quot;the regular&quot; = 6 warm PBRs and a half-eaten bag of pretzel crisps.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">An important thing to realize is that the drinks/snacks in your green room were technically paid for by YOU - it&#039;s not a gift from the venue.  It&#039;s part of their hospitality budget -- one of the &quot;show expenses&quot;, money that would otherwise go directly to you (and it can, see below). The only &quot;gift&quot; part is that they did the shopping (with your money).  Sometimes I say &quot;instead of our rider, can you just give us the hospitality budget in cash?&quot; when i&#039;m tired of veggie platters and pre-cut fruit, and would rather have the cash.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">In that vein, a <b>buy-out </b>is when the venue hands you some cash in lieu of giving you a full meal, etc.  This is very common with medium-larger clubs.  Sometimes you&#039;ll get snacks in the green room + a buy-out (usually like $10-20 per person).  It&#039;s kind of weird but don&#039;t over think it, if someone at the venue says &quot;Here&#039;s your buyout&quot; and hands you cash, just smile and nod (but not in a weird way).<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">A note to bandleaders -- please never keep all of the buyout to yourself, this is not money for you - its meant for each individual performing, their food money.</li>
</ul></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Green room</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Drink tickets / food</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Guest lists<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">A guest list is a list of people that can get into the show for free.  Typically the venue will say &quot;There are 15 guest list spots for the whole package&quot; meaning, between all the bands on the bill, you get a total of 15 spots.  If you&#039;re one of the support bands, and it&#039;s not &quot;your show&quot;, definitely make sure to still request 20-25 guest list spots (very much joking)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Guest list spots are great and feel fun to give to friends -- and you should!  But also realize that for a door deal show, if you put a ton of people on the guest list, you (and - importantly - <i>the other bands who don&#039;t even know your guests</i>) will make less money.  Especially if they are friends that make good money and were going to come to the show anyways, and they just want to be on the guest list because it makes them feel cool -- do not feel obligated to put these people on the list.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">In that same vein - if your friend is playing a local show, and you can afford the ticket, please do not ask for a guest list spot - the bands on the bill deserve to get paid and you don&#039;t need the free ticket</li>
</ul>Different roles for venue staff - production, sound, lights,</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Merch - merch cuts<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Every now and then, you&#039;ll run into the dreaded Merch Cut.  This is when the venue, for some reason, thinks that they deserve a cut of your merch - because they were so gracious as to allow you to use their space to sell your records that represent your entire hopes and dreams and a ton of money and time spent rehearsing and writing and recording -- definitely makes sense that the venue should get a cut of that</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">They typically only take a cut (if there is one) on &quot;soft&quot; goods -- which means shirts, not records/cds/tapes</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Since you agreed to the merch cut (in theory) when you agreed to the show deal, you should of course obey this rule and truthfully pay exactly how much you owe</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Just kidding! haha</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">You can say &quot;Oh we actually didn&#039;t sell any shirts&quot; and dare them to prove it, or say you sold less than you did, while trying to make the promoter feel as shamed as possible</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">In practice, i rarely have had to pay this, the promoters were mostly &quot;cool&quot; and said &quot;Oh we were going to take a cut but i know you barely sold anything, don&#039;t worry about it&quot; -- BUT that is my own experience and surely not everyone&#039;s, so be ready</li>

<i>In case i didn&#039;t explain every little bit of &quot;lingo&quot;, here&#039;s a great collection of some terms you may encounter in booking your show.  Knowing this vocabulary can help you communicate efficiently and signal to the talent buyer that you know what you’re doing.</i><br />

 <br />
<b>Promoter</b><br />
 In some cities, the venue acts as the promoter. They book and promote the show.  In other cities, there are promoters who work with the venues to book and/ or promote the show.  This can be important to understand as there can be increased need for communication when you’re working with both a venue and a promoter.  If it isn’t totally clear who is responsible for what, make sure you ask!  Venues and promoters all have their own ways of operating.<br />
 <br />
<b>Hold</b><br />
 Getting a hold on a date means that the venue will mark the date for you while they continue to book the date for other parties.  Think of it as them writing the date in pencil until they decide which show to book.   You may find that you’ll get a 2nd or 3rd hold.  That means you’re 2nd or 3rd in line to get the show.  Asking a venue to hold a date can be helpful on your first outreach to the venue or if you’re booking a tour and aren’t sure which date you’ll be at their venue.<br />
 <br />
<b>Challenge</b><br />
 If you have a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. hold on a date, and you have all of your ducks in a row (other bands booked, finances sorted, etc.) you can challenge the other holds for the date.  That means that the talent buyer will consider your date against the other holds they have.  If your show looks more promising, they might go with you.  I only ever do this when I need to know for sure if the date is happening.  If I don’t get the date, I usually look into something else.<br />
 <br />
<b>Support</b><br />
 Generally this is a term for other bands playing the show.  More specifically, it’s a term for the band playing before the headliner.  In a 3 band bill, the middle band is usually considered “support” or “direct support”.  This act is usually responsible for bringing more people than the opener and is generally compensated more.<br />
 <br />
<b>Opener</b><br />
 The first performer of the evening.<br />
 <br />
<b>Package</b><br />
 All the bands playing the show are sometimes referred to as “the package”.  Be sure you talk to the talent buyer about who is responsible for booking the package. Most venues will make you do it.<br />
 <br />
<b>Guarantee</b><br />
 A guarantee is a set number that you will receive from the venue or promoter.  Be sure to communicate about whether that guarantee is just for your band or for the whole package.  If it’s for the whole package, then you need to communicate with the other bands about how much they get.<br />
 <br />
<b>Door Deal</b><br />
 This is a percentage of the ticket sales.  You want to communicate about this % is as soon as possible.  You should know what it is before you confirm the show.<br />
 <br />
<b>Overhead</b><br />
 The expenses the venue pays to put on the show.  This can include sound person, other staffing, taxes, promotion and a bunch of other things.  Some venues have a flat rate and can send you an itemized list of the expenses.  I always ask for that.  Generally, venues need to cover this before they’ll pay out the door deal.  You need to be sure you ask if your door deal is before or after expenses.<br />
 <br />
<b>Confirm</b><br />
 To get the date.  Once the date is confirmed, it’s yours!<br />
 <br />
<b>Announce</b><br />
 The date the show will be announced to the public.  The venue should give you ticket link if they have it.<br />
 <br />
<b>Advance (noun)</b><br />
 The advance is a form with all the info you’ll need for the show: ROS, load in time, directions, wifi info, green room info, etc.<br />
 <br />
<b>Advance (verb)</b><br />
 To advance a show is to send an advance.<br />
 <br />
<b>ROS</b><br />
 Run of show.  This is the sequence of bands, their start times and set times.<br />
 <br />
<b>DOS</b><br />
 Day Of Show<br />
 <br />
<b>FOH</b><br />
 Front of House.  This is the sound person.<br />
 <br />
<b>Settle</b><br />
 The venue paying you for the show.  Usually it’s the venue manager or bar manager.  It can be good to ask who you’ll be settling with when you load in.  Be sure to ask for # of tickets sold.  Double check their numbers with what you agreed on with the talent buyer.  Sometimes communication breaks down.</div>

</div><br />
Other tips:<br />
<br />
<b>Timeline</b><br />
 <br />
 Club dates: reach out 3-6 months out from your date.  The further out you confirm the date, the more time you have to promote it.<br />
 <br />
 Festivals: 9-12 months out.  For Spring and Summer dates, I usually reach out in the fall to say hi and ask when they will be selecting bands.  Then I follow up sometime before the selection dates.<br />
 <br />
 Colleges: the middle or end of a semester.  For a fall date, reach out in the spring. in the fall for a spring date.<br />
 <br />
 Follow Up<br />
 <br />
 2-4 times.  I like to stagger my follow ups like this:<br />
 2 weeks after first outreach<br />
 1 week later<br />
 3-5 days later</div>

        "articleBody": "HOW I DO SHOWS???\nby TCUP\n\nLike many industries, the \"live music\" world can sometimes feel opaque and confusing from the outside (and also...the inside), with lots of knowledge that can be hard to come by if you don't have a ton of experience - inscrutable lingo (What are \"deads\"? What does \"front of house\" mean?? What is a \"buyout\"??!! What does \"Spotify demonetized my music\" mean???!!!), poor communication, some venue owners doing their best to rip you off, intimidating sound engineers, and more.\n\nAnd like many industries, the barrier to entry is higher if you're not a straight white dude with lots of straight white dude friends who play in bands already who tell you what to do / how to get shows / ask you if you want to \"jam\" sometime / care way more about having expensive guitars than actually learning how to play guitar / secretly think Joe Rogan has some good ideas, and so on.\n\n\n\nThis guide is an attempt to help level the playing field, to present some shared wisdom from musicians who have been at it a while.  This is merely one perspective, mostly around the \"playing small clubs / rooms around 60-500 capacity\" world, based on our varied experiences. These \"best practices\" and tips are by no means definitive, set in stone, or immovable. Ya gotta find what works for you but if you don\u2019t know what that is yet, this is a good place to start!\n\nSome of this may seem obvious, but hopefully there's helpful info for everyone here - from (one end of the spectrum) someone who's never played a show,  to (the other end of the spectrum) a member of the Grateful Dead.\n\n This is organized roughly by order-of-operations when booking a show + playing that show.\n\nnote: I'm using the word \"band\" throughout as shorthand for \"artist / musician / performer / etc\", obviously not everyone is in a \"band\" but i'm lazy\n\n\n\nMAKING A SHOW HAPPEN\n\nI want to play a show in town - how do I make that happen?\n\n\nWhat are the venue's motivations for booking me?  Why do they care how many people I might bring out?\n\n\nWhen booking my own show, do I get a date confirmed with the venue first, and then ask other bands to play? Or how do I do it? \n\n\nWhat do I say when I reach out to the venue initially?\n[/spoiler]\n\nHow does payment work? How do I make sure I don't get ripped off?\n\n\n\nI BOOKED A SHOW.  NOW WHAT? \n\nWhat do I need to decide ahead of time with the other bands?\n\n\nHere's an example of a similar email, but from the venue/promoter (First Ave, in this case) -- this is a great example of a typical show advance (other than the fact that \"y'all\" appears twice in the first 7 words), showing how the night works and what info the venue might ask you for.\n\n\n\nAND finally, here's an example of an email I sent to a venue ahead of our show there (before a tour of ours started) -- i hadn't heard anything from them yet, so I led with the advance:\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nHow do you figure out the schedule / timing of the show?\n\n\nHow do I promote my show?\n\n\n\n\nDAY OF THE SHOW\n\nWhat does the day of the show look like? How do sound checks work?\n\n\nWhat's a stage plot?\n\n\nHow do you deal with the sound engineer?\n\n\nHow do I get paid?\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nWhat else do I need to know?\n\nThe fun thing is, venues honor these requests approximately 1% of the time!  You'll usually just get \"the regular\" = 6 warm PBRs and a half-eaten bag of pretzel crisps.\nAn important thing to realize is that the drinks/snacks in your green room were technically paid for by YOU - it's not a gift from the venue.  It's part of their hospitality budget -- one of the \"show expenses\", money that would otherwise go directly to you (and it can, see below). The only \"gift\" part is that they did the shopping (with your money).  Sometimes I say \"instead of our rider, can you just give us the hospitality budget in cash?\" when i'm tired of veggie platters and pre-cut fruit, and would rather have the cash.\nIn that vein, a buy-out is when the venue hands you some cash in lieu of giving you a full meal, etc.  This is very common with medium-larger clubs.  Sometimes you'll get snacks in the green room + a buy-out (usually like $10-20 per person).  It's kind of weird but don't over think it, if someone at the venue says \"Here's your buyout\" and hands you cash, just smile and nod (but not in a weird way).\n\nA note to bandleaders -- please never keep all of the buyout to yourself, this is not money for you - its meant for each individual performing, their food money.\n\nGreen room\nDrink tickets / food\nGuest lists\n\nA guest list is a list of people that can get into the show for free.  Typically the venue will say \"There are 15 guest list spots for the whole package\" meaning, between all the bands on the bill, you get a total of 15 spots.  If you're one of the support bands, and it's not \"your show\", definitely make sure to still request 20-25 guest list spots (very much joking)\nGuest list spots are great and feel fun to give to friends -- and you should!  But also realize that for a door deal show, if you put a ton of people on the guest list, you (and - importantly - the other bands who don't even know your guests) will make less money.  Especially if they are friends that make good money and were going to come to the show anyways, and they just want to be on the guest list because it makes them feel cool -- do not feel obligated to put these people on the list.\nIn that same vein - if your friend is playing a local show, and you can afford the ticket, please do not ask for a guest list spot - the bands on the bill deserve to get paid and you don't need the free ticket\n\nDifferent roles for venue staff - production, sound, lights,\nMerch - merch cuts\n\nEvery now and then, you'll run into the dreaded Merch Cut.  This is when the venue, for some reason, thinks that they deserve a cut of your merch - because they were so gracious as to allow you to use their space to sell your records that represent your entire hopes and dreams and a ton of money and time spent rehearsing and writing and recording -- definitely makes sense that the venue should get a cut of that\nThey typically only take a cut (if there is one) on \"soft\" goods -- which means shirts, not records/cds/tapes\nSince you agreed to the merch cut (in theory) when you agreed to the show deal, you should of course obey this rule and truthfully pay exactly how much you owe\nJust kidding! haha\nYou can say \"Oh we actually didn't sell any shirts\" and dare them to prove it, or say you sold less than you did, while trying to make the promoter feel as shamed as possible\nIn practice, i rarely have had to pay this, the promoters were mostly \"cool\" and said \"Oh we were going to take a cut but i know you barely sold anything, don't worry about it\" -- BUT that is my own experience and surely not everyone's, so be ready\n\n[/LIST]\n[/LIST]\n\n [/spoiler]\n \n \n\n\n IT'S TIME FOR YOUR SET !\n \n \n \n\n\nIn case i didn't explain every little bit of \"lingo\", here's a great collection of some terms you may encounter in booking your show.  Knowing this vocabulary can help you communicate efficiently and signal to the talent buyer that you know what you\u2019re doing.\n \nVOCABULARY\n \n\nOther tips:\n\nTimeline\n \n Club dates: reach out 3-6 months out from your date.  The further out you confirm the date, the more time you have to promote it.\n \n Festivals: 9-12 months out.  For Spring and Summer dates, I usually reach out in the fall to say hi and ask when they will be selecting bands.  Then I follow up sometime before the selection dates.\n \n Colleges: the middle or end of a semester.  For a fall date, reach out in the spring. in the fall for a spring date.\n \n Follow Up\n \n 2-4 times.  I like to stagger my follow ups like this:\n 2 weeks after first outreach\n 1 week later\n 3-5 days later"
