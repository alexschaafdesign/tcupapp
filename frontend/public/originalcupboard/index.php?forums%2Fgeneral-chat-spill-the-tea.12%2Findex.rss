<br />
I’m making some collages for TCUP’s socials and I need some photos of bands loading in, soundchecking, running merch, hanging in the green room, etc.  Basically, anything from the day of a show that shows  the non-music making labor parts of the job.<br />
<br />
Do you have any and are you willing to share them?  If so, drop ‘em in this thread and lmk the handle you’d like tagged.<br />

Thanks!<br />

<br />
Over the last couple months we&#039;ve collected feedback about different venues around town with our <a href="https://airtable.com/appBxG22efe9yoPaa/pagoL9lvXsNovlvak/form" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Venue Report Card Survey</a> - and we have noticed some shady practices at Day Block Brewery that I&#039;ll detail below. Have you played a show there recently? What was your experience? <br />
<br />
-We have consistently heard from TCUP members and VRC respondents that the venue is inconsistent when it comes to ticketing at shows. If someone is running the door, they might cut the door halfway...<br />

<br />
I was very disappointed that a booker with Caydence expected us to &quot;pay to play&quot; for a show that is intended to raise aid for community members. The message I received felt extremely disrespectful and made me feel humiliated when all of us are trying to organize and do a good thing.<br />
<br />
Back story, we recently got in touch with Caydence to host a benefit show with a bill full of young folks ages 17-24. The show was initially going to be for LA fire relief aid as we started planning...<br />

<br />
i&#039;m collecting “advance horror stories” (i.e., tales of past gigs where lack of a clear show advance/contract caused issues for you and/or your band), as well as positive thoughts/experiences surrounding show advances, for the next issue of the TCUP newsletter!<br />
<br />
if you&#039;ve got a story you&#039;d like to share (and are willing to have it publicized), please drop it in this thread. feel free to leave out any identifying details if you are worried about repercussions.<br />

I&#039;ve been booking the bands I play in since 2008 but it seems like over the last two to three years venues have gotten really lax on responding. Back before Covid, I would hear back within 24 to 72 hours now weeks will go by and nothing. Sending another follow up message doesn&#039;t seem to help. I realize that the number of bands and solo artists around the metro area...<br />

Some venues act like ticket sales are the only source of revenue to cover expenses; having more data might help challenge that assertion. It&#039;s awkward to ask though so I&#039;m looking for advice. Thanks!</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">(this may seem dumb/obvious but bear with me) -- for house shows, I know people typically do the “DM for address / ask a punk” thing for these kind of shows, which i of course understand from a security/privacy perspective -- but like, in practice, i&#039;m just giving my address to anyone who DMs me, whether I know them or not, and they could easily send it to their friends etc, so it doesn&#039;t feel like that &quot;secure&quot; necessarily.  <br />
<br />
so is there a strong reason why I shouldn’t just put my address...<br />

My band, Gully Boys, has a new single coming out next week and we are running a pre-save campaign in hopes that the streaming gods take notice and show our tunes to new folks. If you have a second, would you mind pre-saving lol ?<br />
